# Proof-of-Work-C++
This is a simple Proof of Work function you can use in your application

You can completely customize the settings including the difficulty and therefore the time taken to solve the Algorithm



> [!NOTE]
> A modified version of this code is also used in the Pluto Loader

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user has to have the openssl library installed or the required dll´s have to be supplied with the application

> [!WARNING]
> It´s important to use some kind of protector (as in a virtualizer or packer) in order to prevent function patches to bypass the Proof of Work Algorithm
